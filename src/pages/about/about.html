  <p>We are three year 8 students that share a loved passion for dogs.
  That is why came up with the idea of creating a dog walking business.</p>
  <p>My Dog Walk was created through the Bialik College ETGAR program, which
  gives students the chance to try exciting new opportunities.</p>
  <p>We chosethe build a business elective, which gives students a chance to create
  a business. The main idea was to create a product, which could be sold
  and enjoyed.</p>
  <p>Instead, we wanted to create something that would last a
  long time and hopefully give people an opportunity to hang out with a
  cuddly pooch.</p>
  <p>The idea of MDW is to get people out and about and
  exercising while hanging out with a dog. After many months of consideration,
  we decided to make this dream a reality. At first, we thought it would take
  forever but we soon realised it was easier than it sounds. Now, children
  and adults can enjoy walking because they are getting to hang out with
  the most awesome animals on earth!</p>
